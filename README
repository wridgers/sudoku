sudoku - By Will of mindfuzz.net
-------------------------------------------------

This is a 'logical' sudoku solver. It will attempt to solve the
sudoku through logical steps and strategies. The idea is it should
be able to tell you how the sudoku was solved. It does not and
it will never brute force the solution.

Such strategies can be found here:
	http://www.sudokuwiki.org/Strategy_Families

At the moment only one simple strategy is employed, more should
soon follow.

The build system uses premake 4, so you'll need a copy of premak4
from http://industriousone.com/premake

Steps to compile (Linux):
1. premake4 gmake
2. make

This will also compile on Windows/Mac. Premake4 will create all the
build tools for you. For example "premake4 codeblocks" will create
code::blocks project files.
